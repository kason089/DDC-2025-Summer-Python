# 🧃 Juice Bar Recommender

"""
🍓🥭 Welcome to the Code Island Juice Bar! 🏝️🍹

Today’s mission: Become a juice engineer and create a drink just for your customer.

🔍 What you’ll practice:
- input() to ask questions
- if/elif/else to make decisions
- Creative logic to match mood + flavor to a drink

🧪 Your Job:
1. Ask your customer (user) some questions.
2. Use logic to recommend the perfect drink.
3. Keep it fun, personal, and colorful!

🎨 Remix Challenges (do at least 3):
✅ Add 2–3 new moods and drink combos
✅ Let customers choose an extra topping (boba, glitter, etc)
✅ Print a receipt with name, order, and fake total price
✅ Add a secret VIP code that gives a mystery drink
✅ Add emoji art or a creative title
✅ Show a funny message if someone picks a weird fruit like “pickle”

🧠 Bonus Challenge (for fast coders):
- Add a surprise drink using random.choice()
- Let users build their own drink from 3 ingredients
- Use a loop to serve multiple customers in a row

📸 When You Finish:
- Screenshot your funniest or best drink output
- Write 1–2 sentences about what you changed
- Submit your .py file or Replit link to the class page
